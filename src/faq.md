# FAQ

### Q: What is the relationship between RSS4 and RSS?

A: The founders of RSS4 are big fans of RSS, and aspire to the free and open Internet typically represented by RSS in the Web1 era. We made the [RSSHub](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub) project based on the RSS protocol in an effort to integrate RSS with Web2 products, but due to the many limitations of the protocol, the project is like dancing with shackles on its feet. We all know that the design of RSS is no longer able to meet the more complex information aggregation and distribution needs of the current Internet. So we create RSS4, expecting that the spirit of RSS would be passed on in the Web3 era. In order to meet the complex needs of Web2 and Web3, the design and implementation of RSS4 is very different from RSS, and they are no other related except for the purpose and design concept.

### Q: Is RSS4 a SocialFi?

A: No. RSS4 can indeed be used for social, but it is not limited to social, it is an infrastructure for information distribution and can be used for any scenario that requires information distribution, such as NFT marketplace, personal resume, personal blog, posting notifications, etc.
