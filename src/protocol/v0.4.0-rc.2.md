<!-- # RSS3 Protocol v0.4.0-rc.2 -->

::: warning
Documentation is not yet complete and content may be very unstable
:::

## 1. Abstract

The right to create, disseminate and distribute information should not be in the hands of centralized governing. It is the basic right of cyber lives.

Gradually over the past two decades, several data superpowers have controlled contents and links to create a toxic centralized atmosphere, where privacy and freedom are sacrificed for profits. This atmosphere further hinders innovations: No matter how well you design and engineer your application, there is no way to compete with the data monopolies.

The world has been eager for a new way of information syndication. RSS used to be the pioneer of its time, now it’s time for us to pick up the baton and carry on.

Derived from the best out of RSS, RSS3 is an open information syndication protocol that aims to support efficient and decentralized information distribution in Web3. It defines the format of information presence and communication, with this elegantly designed, user-friendly content format, clients can easily access a variety of content sources in a uniform format without the need for extensive compatibility logic.

## 2. Status of This Document

This version is a beta version, although this protocol is well established in theory, it still needs to be tested in practice, so it is not guaranteed to be compatible with subsequent versions, but breaking updates will be kept to a minimum.

## 3. Dependencies

- [RFC 3986 - Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986): The protocol uses a large number of RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifiers to identify things in RSS3.
- [RFC 6838 - Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6838): The value of the item.attachment.mime_type field in the protocol uses the RFC 6838 standard.
- [JSON Schema: A Media Type for Describing JSON Documents](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-00): The protocol provides the user with a series of JSON Schema to do format validation.
- [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601): All times appearing in the protocol use the extended ISO 8601 format with 3 decimals (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ).

## 4. Main Concepts

### 4.1. Basic Properties

RSS3 clients exchange data with the server using fixed-structure JSON.

The mime_type of RSS3 file is `application/rss3+json`, it is recommended to include `content-type: application/rss3+json; charset=utf-8` in the Response Headers of RSS3 file response.

Each response has some basic properties.

```ts
type ResponseBase<URIType, ElementType> = {
    version: 'v0.4.0';
    date_updated: string;

    identifier: URIType;
    identifier_next?: URIType;

    total: number;
    list?: ElementType[];
}
```

#### 4.1.1. `version`

Version of the protocol, the current is `v0.4.0`.

#### 4.1.2. `date_updated`

The update time of the response, in the format of extended ISO 8601 with 3 decimals (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ).

#### 4.1.3. `identifier`

The protocol uses a number of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) that conform to the [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) standard to identify things in RSS3.

##### 4.1.3.1. Scheme

The scheme is `rss3`. I.e. RSS3 URI starts with `rss3://`.

##### 4.1.3.2. Authority

The protocol uses Instance as an authority.

##### 4.1.3.3. URI

You don't need to know what each URI means now, as will be explained separately later.

For example,

- `rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum`
- `rss3://asset:0xb9619cf4f875cdf0e3ce48b28a1c725bc4f6c0fb-1024@ethereum`
- `rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/notes?limit=5&last_time=2022-01-01T00:00:000Z`
- `rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/links/following?limit=5`
- `rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/backlinks?type=following&limit=5`

##### 4.1.3.4. `identifier_next`

The URI used to identify the next page. If not specified, the current page is the last one by default.

For example:

```json
{
    "identifier":      "rss3://account:0xtest@ethereum/notes?limit=5",
    "identifier_next": "rss3://account:0xtest@ethereum/notes?limit=5&last_time=2022-01-01T00:00:000Z"
}
```

#### 4.1.4. `total`

Total number of elements in this page and its next pages.

#### 4.1.5. `list`

List elements, depending on the type of the response, may be profile, link, backlink, asset, note, etc.

### 4.2. Instance

An instance is an RSS3 interactive object and an RSS3 presence unit.

#### 4.2.1. URI

```xsl
InstanceURI = rss3://<prefix>:<identity>@<platform>
```

- `prefix` is one constant of `account`, `asset`, `note`;
- `platform` is the platform to which the instance belongs. The platform of account is defined by [RIP-1: Registered Account Platforms](./RIPs/RIP-1.md), and the platform of item is defined by [RIP-3: Registered Item Networks](./RIPs/RIP-3.md) and [RIP-4: Registered Indexed Items](./RIPs/RIP-4.md);
- `identity` is the unique ID of the instance on this platform.

##### 4.2.1.1. Account Instance

There are two types of accounts

- Main Account: the account in the Instance URI, which represents the instance.

- Connected Accounts: accounts in the `profile.connected_accounts` field, which represents other accounts belonging to the instance.

An account consists of two pieces of information: the account ID and the platform to which the account belongs.

```xsl
AccountInstanceURI = rss3://account:<identity>@<account_platform>
```

- `identity` is the unique account ID within the platform;
- `account_platform` is defined by [RIP-1: Registered Account Platforms](./RIPs/RIP-1.md).

For example,

- An Ethereum account can be identified as `rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum`.

- A Twitter account can be identified as `rss3://account:DIYgod@twitter`.

##### 4.2.1.2. Asset Instance and Note Instance

An asset or a note can be interacted with independently as an instance.

```xsl
AssetInstanceURI = rss3://asset:<metadata_proof>@<asset_network>
NoteInstanceURI  = rss3://note:<metadata_proof>@<note_network>
```

For example,

- `rss3://asset:0xacbe98efe2d4d103e221e04c76d7c55db15c8e89-5@ethereum`
- `rss3://note:1483972580616949762@twitter`

#### 4.2.2. Response

Specify the URIs of profiles, links, assets, notes of the current instance.

```ts
type InstanceResponse = ResponseBase<InstanceURI, {
    type: "profiles" | "links" | "backlinks" | "assets" | "notes",
    identifier: ProfilesURI | LinksURI | BacklinksURI | AssetsURI | NotesURI,
}>
```

##### 4.2.2.1. Account Instance

For example,

```json
{
    "version": "v0.4.0",
    "date_updated": "2022-01-01T00:00:000Z",

    "identifier": "rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum",

    "total": 4,
    "list": [
        {
            "type": "profiles",
            "identifier": "rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/profiles"
        },
        {
            "type": "links",
            "identifier": "rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/links"
        },
        {
            "type": "backlinks",
            "identifier": "rss3://asset:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/backlinks"
        },
        {
            "type": "assets",
            "identifier": "rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/assets"
        },
        {
            "type": "notes",
            "identifier": "rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/notes"
        },
    ]
}
```

##### 4.2.2.2. Asset Instance and Note Instance

For example,

```json
{
    "version": "v0.4.0",
    "date_updated": "2022-01-01T00:00:000Z",

    "identifier": "rss3://asset:0xacbe98efe2d4d103e221e04c76d7c55db15c8e89-5@ethereum",

    "total": 4,
    "list": [
        {
            "type": "profiles",
            "identifier": "rss3://asset:0xacbe98efe2d4d103e221e04c76d7c55db15c8e89-5@ethereum/profiles"
        },
        {
            "type": "links",
            "identifier": "rss3://asset:0xacbe98efe2d4d103e221e04c76d7c55db15c8e89-5@ethereum/links"
        },
        {
            "type": "backlinks",
            "identifier": "rss3://asset:0xacbe98efe2d4d103e221e04c76d7c55db15c8e89-5@ethereum/backlinks"
        },
        {
            "type": "assets",
            "identifier": "rss3://asset:0xacbe98efe2d4d103e221e04c76d7c55db15c8e89-5@ethereum/assets"
        },
        {
            "type": "notes",
            "identifier": "rss3://asset:0xacbe98efe2d4d103e221e04c76d7c55db15c8e89-5@ethereum/notes"
        },
    ]
}
```

### 4.3. Profiles

Profiles record the basic information of the instance, including the name, avatar, profile, configs, etc.

#### 4.3.1. URI

```xsl
ProfilesURI = <InstanceURI>/profiles[?<query_string>]
```

Available queries:

| Key | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| profile_networks | If specified, returning only profiles with `metadata.network` field in the filter list. Multiple values are separated by commas. |

E.g.,

- All profiles of a instance from all supported netwroks:

    ```text
    rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/profiles
    ```

- The profile from Crossbell Netwrok:

    ```text
    rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/profiles?profile_networks=crossbell
    ```

#### 4.3.2. Response

```ts
type ProfilesResponse = ResponseBase<ProfilesURI, {
    name?: string;
    avatars?: URI[];
    bio?: string;
    attachments?: {
        type?: string;
        content?: string;
        address?: URI;
        mime_type: string;
        size_in_bytes?: number;
    }[];

    connected_accounts?: AccountInstanceURI[];

    metadata?: {
        network: ProfileNetworkName;
        proof: string;

        [key: string]: any;
    };
}>
```

##### 4.3.2.1. `profile.name`

The name of the instance, such as the user's screen name, the asset's title.

##### 4.3.2.2. `profile.avatars`

Instance icons, such as the user's avatar and asset images, can be set multiple at the same time, and applications should generally choose the first to display.

##### 4.3.2.3. `profile.bio`

Textual introduction to the instance.

##### 4.3.2.4. `profile.attachments`

`profile` is a very flexible and diverse information. The protocol cannot predict all requirements, so only a few of the most commonly used information are defined, and it is expected to use the `attachments` field to record the profile information that is not clearly defined, such as `websites`, `banner`.

For example:

```json
{
    "attachments": [
        {
            "type": "websites",
            "content": "https://rss3.io\nhttps://diygod.me",
            "mime_type": "text/uri-list",
        },
        {
            "type": "banner",
            "content": "ipfs://QmT1zZNHvXxdTzHesfEdvFjMPvw536Ltbup7B4ijGVib7t",
            "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
        }
    ]
}
```

##### 4.3.2.5. `profile.connected_accounts`

The main account can connect to other accounts, including accounts of cryptography-based decentralized and centralized platforms.

When getting links, assets or notes, client can get not only the content of the main account, but also the content of the connected account.

### 4.4. Links and Backlinks

Links describes the relationship between two instances.

#### 4.4.1. URI

```xsl
LinksURI     = <InstanceURI>/links[?<query_string>]
BacklinksURI = <InstanceURI>/backlinks[?<query_string>]
```

Available queries:

| Key | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| type | Returning only links with this type. Defined by [RIP-5: Registered Link Types](./RIPs/RIP-5.md). |
| limit | Used for pagination, limiting the count of the returning elements. There should be a maximum and minimal value when implementing. |
| last_instance | Used for pagination. If specified, returning the instances after this instance. |
| instance | If specified, returning only the list containing this instance. If specified but no list satisfies, returning null list. |
| link_network | If specified, returning only links with `metadata.network` field in the filter list. Multiple values are separated by commas. |
| profile_network | If specified, try to get Connected Accounts from this network, and return items belonging to Connected Accounts and Main Account, otherwise only items belonging to Main Account are returned |

E.g.

- The following list

    ```text
    rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/links?type=following
    ```

- The followed list

    ```text
    rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/backlinks?type=following
    ```

- Query if an instance is followed by another instance:

    ```text
    rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/links?type=following&instance=rss3%3A%2F%2F0x8768515270aA67C624d3EA3B98CA464672C50183%40ethereum
    ```

- Query if an instance is following another instance:

    ```text
    rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/backlinks?type=following&instance=rss3%3A%2F%2F0x8768515270aA67C624d3EA3B98CA464672C50183%40ethereum
    ```

- A note’s comments:

    ```text
    rss3://note:1483972580616949762@twitter/backlinks?type=comment
    ```

#### 4.4.2. Response

```ts
type LinksResponse = ResponseBase<LinksURI, {
    from: InstanceURI;
    to: InstanceURI;
    type: LinkType;

    metadata?: {
        network: LinkNetworkName;
        proof: string;

        [key: string]: any;
    };
}>
```

##### 4.4.2.1. `link.from`

The starting point of the link. For link, it must be one of the instance's Main Account and Connected Accounts. For backlink, it can be any instance.

##### 4.4.2.2. `link.to`

The end point of the link. For link, it can be any instance. For backlink, it must be one of the instance's Main Account and Connected Accounts.

##### 4.4.2.3. `link.type`

Defined by [RIP-5: Registered Link Types](./RIPs/RIP-5.md).

### 4.5. Assets and Notes

Assets are the assets owned by instances, which can also be extended and interpreted as any fixed display content according to different usage scenarios, such as an NFT, a game achievement, a physical figure, a commodity for sale, etc.

Notes are the actions or events generated by the instance, which can also be extended and interpreted as any stream content according to different usage scenarios, such as writing a blog post, getting a NFT dynamic, writing a forum post, posting a reply to other notes, posting a comment to an assets, donation to others, etc.

Both are in the same format, so the protocol describes them together, and together they are called item

#### 4.5.2. URI

```xsl
AssetsURI = <InstanceURI>/assets[?<query_string>]
NotesURI = <InstanceURI>/notes[?<query_string>]
```

Available queries:

| Key | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| limit | Used for pagination, limiting the count of the returning elements. There should be a maximum and minimal value when implementing. |
| last_time | Used for pagination. An ISO 8601 time. If specified, returning only items created before this time. |
| tags | If specified, returning only items of the corresponding tags (filtered using the `tags` attribute of items). Multiple values are separated by commas. |
| mime_types | If specified, returning only items with `attachments.mime_type` field containing the corresponding values. Multiple values are separated by commas. |
| item_network | If specified, returning only items with `metadata.network` field in the filter list. Multiple values are separated by commas. |
| link_network and link_type | If specified, items belonging to instaces linked by current instace are returned |
| profile_network | If specified, try to get Connected Accounts from this network, and return items belonging to Connected Accounts and Main Account, otherwise only items belonging to Main Account are returned |

E.g.,

- The list of the first 5 notes on Crossbell Network:

    ```text
    rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/notes?limit=5
    ```

- Assuming that the date_created of the 5th item is `2022-01-01T00:00:000Z`, then the list of the second 5 notes:

    ```text
    rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/notes?limit=5&last_time=2022-01-01T00:00:000Z
    ```

- You can get not only the item of the Main Account, but also the item of the Connected Accounts in profile:

    ```text
    rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/notes?limit=5&profile_network=crossbell
    ```

- In addition to getting your own notes, you can also get the notes of people you follow:

    ```text
    rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum/notes?limit=5&link_network=crossbell&link_type=following
    ```

#### Response

```ts
type ItemsResponse = ResponseBase<AssetsURI | NotesURI, {
    identifier: AssetInstanceURI | NoteInstanceURI;
    date_created: string;
    date_updated: string;

    related_urls?: string[];

    links: LinksURI;
    backlinks: BacklinksURI;

    tags?: string[];
    authors: AccountInstanceURI[];
    title?: string;
    summary?: string;
    attachments?: {
        type?: string;
        content?: string;
        address?: URI;
        mime_type: string;
        size_in_bytes?: number;
    }[];

    metadata?: {
        network: ItemNetworkName;
        proof: string;

        [key: string]: any;
    };
}>
```

##### 4.5.3.5. `item.identifier`

`identifier` is the uri of the item. See [Instance URI](#_4-4-3-1-instance-uri).

##### 4.5.3.1. `item.date_created`

The time when the notes or assets was posted or generated, in the format of ISO 8601, such as the time when the article was published, the time when the NFT was mint, the time when the product was put on the shelf, etc.

##### 4.5.3.2. `item.date_updated`

The time of an action or item change, in the format of ISO 8601, such as article modification time, last transaction or modification time of an NFT, etc.

##### 4.5.3.4. `item.related_urls`

URLs associated with the item, such as the address of the item in the indexed network.

##### 4.5.3.6. `item.links`

Links URI of current item. It must be `<AssetInstanceURI | NoteInstanceURI>/links`

##### 4.5.3.6. `item.backlinks`

Backlinks URI of current item. It must be `<AssetInstanceURI | NoteInstanceURI>/backlinks`

##### 4.5.3.7. `item.tags`

`tags` is an array of strings. Similar to the concept of tags commonly used in personal blogs, you can add multiple tags to an article; the Indexed Items will also have tags, indicating the type of the item, and the specific value is limited in [RIP-4: Registered Indexed Items](./RIPs/RIP-4.md).

##### 4.5.3.8. `item.authors`

`authors` is an array of Accounts, indicating the accounts who have produced this item, such as the author of the article, the seller of the product, etc. It can be omitted if it is the current instance address.

If the item is an Indexed Item and the author is a Connected Account, it will additionally contain the Main Account.

##### 4.5.3.9. `item.title` and `item.summary`

The content of a `summary` cannot be too long, and the RSS3 Network should set a maximum length.

If it is a short content, then it is likely to only have a `summary` without a `title`, such as a Tweet from Twitter.

If it is a long article and its word count exceeds the size limit, then its `summary` should only be a summary or truncation of the article, and the complete content should be placed in `attachments`.

##### 4.5.3.10. `item.attachments`

`attachments` records the attachments of this item, such as images of the article, etc. If it is a long article, it may also contain the full text of the article.

###### 4.5.3.10.1. `item.attachments[i].type`

The type of attachment, indicating the function or classification of this attachment, such as thumbnail, detailed description, etc.

This value can be any string.

###### 4.5.3.10.2. `item.attachments[i].content` and `item.attachments[i].address`

`content` is the actual content of the attachment, such as the full body of the article or the base64 string of an image. The content of this field may be very long, but the RSS3 Network should also be limited to the maximum length of the content to avoid affecting the storage efficiency of the entire network. Content that exceeds the maximum length limit should be placed in the address field using third-party storage.

`address` is the URI of this attachment pointing to a third-party address, such as a markdown file address or an image address.

`content` and `address` are mutually exclusive, one attachment can only have one and only one of them.

###### 4.5.3.10.3. `item.attachments[i].mime_type`

This records the media type of this attachment. The format must conform to the RFC 6838 standard, such as `image/png`, `text/markdown`, etc. This is an important but easily overlooked field from an application presentation point of view, so the protocol specifies it as a required field.

###### 4.5.3.10.4. `item.attachments[i].size_in_bytes`

This records the size of this attachment in bytes. It is useful for displaying large files such as videos and audios. It is also a field that is easily overlooked. The protocol recommends that the existence and accuracy of this field be ensured as much as possible.

##### 4.5.3.11. `item.metadata`

This records metadata for Indexed Items, with specific values defined in [RIP-4: Registered Indexed Items](./RIPs/RIP-4.md).

###### 4.5.3.11.1. `item.metadata.network`

The network where this item is stored.

Its value is defined by [RIP-3: Registered Item Networks](./RIPs/RIP-3.md).

###### 4.5.3.11.2. `item.metadata.proof`

This records the credentials for indexing this Indexed Item, such as transaction hash and the address of a centralized platform.
