# RIP-1: Registered Account Platforms

## Abstract

RIP-1 is used to describe and qualify the accounts that can be used for RSS4.

## Motivation

The RSS4 protocol does not restrict what platform accounts can be used, which creates uncertainty in implementation and use.

## Cryptography-based Decentralized Platforms

Cryptography-based decentralized platforms do not require a centralized server, but use a public signature algorithm for authentication.

The accounts of these platforms can be used for both Main Accounts and Connected Accounts.

## Centralized Platforms

Centralized platforms require centralized servers for authentication. The user must put the address or name (Refer to [RIP-2: Registered Name Services](./RIPs/RIP-2.md)) of the Main Accounts into some location in the platform's account configuration to verify ownership.

The accounts of these platforms can only be used for Connected Accounts.
