# Week 5 - March 18, 2022

Welcome to the shiny RSS4 Tech Weekly. This week we witnessed our awesome [**üéâ¬†$RSS4 Token**](https://rss3.events/airdrop) and **[üçì Fruit Gang Avatar](https://rss3.events/avatar)** airdrops. We hope you all received some (and make sure you hold onto that).

## What has happened

We are still working hard on our close-to-decentralised implementation of RSS4 Network for the protocol v0.4.0. During this week:

1. To ensure higher availability and stability, we have completed our infra migration to another IaaS platform with a robust orchestration, kudos to our DevOps!
2. Some APIs for retrieving data have been shipped to our testing environment. Try those faster APIs (do not use them in production as they are still in alpha):
    1. Get an account‚Äôs index file: [https://test-pregod.rss3.dev/api/account:0xD3E8ce4841ed658Ec8dcb99B7a74beFC377253EA@ethereum](https://test-pregod.rss3.dev/api/account:0xD3E8ce4841ed658Ec8dcb99B7a74beFC377253EA@ethereum)
    2. Get an account‚Äôs following links: [https://test-pregod.rss3.dev/api/account:0xD3E8ce4841ed658Ec8dcb99B7a74beFC377253EA@ethereum/list/link/following/0](https://test-pregod.rss3.dev/api/account:0xD3E8ce4841ed658Ec8dcb99B7a74beFC377253EA@ethereum/list/link/following/0)
    3. Get an account‚Äôs back-following (follower) links: [https://test-pregod.rss3.dev/api/account:0xD3E8ce4841ed658Ec8dcb99B7a74beFC377253EA@ethereum/list/backlink?limit=10](https://test-pregod.rss3.dev/api/account:0xD3E8ce4841ed658Ec8dcb99B7a74beFC377253EA@ethereum/list/backlink?limit=10)
3. We have started to get our hands dirty on the JS SDK implementation.
4. We have improved the indexing logistics with a simple queue implementation to replace the need for an MQ.
5. We have removed uuid in protocol

## What is going to happen

1. More APIs, including putting files, indexing external network feed etc., will be coming soon.
2. JS SDK for protocol v0.4.0 is expected to be released upon the very week of the stable API release.

That‚Äôs it for the week, see you all next week!
