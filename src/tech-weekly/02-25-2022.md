# Week 2 - February 25, 2022

Welcome to the shiny RSS4 Tech Weekly. Below is the progress made by Dev ðŸŒ€ RSS4.

## What has happened

1. Weâ€™ve finalized and released [RSS4 Protocol v0.4.0-rc](https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/RSS4-Protocol), a major milestone! ðŸŽ‰
2. Weâ€™ve released [detailed documentation](https://rss3.wiki/protocol/v0.4.0-rc.html) and [RSS4 Improvement Proposals](https://rss3.wiki/protocol/RIPs/RIP-1.html) together with the protocol. The documentation also serves as a draft towards a future RFC proposal.
3. We have been busy working on the groundwork of PreGod:
    1. More tech stack options were evaluated, we went really deep and thorough, evaluating third-party libraries in every aspect (stability, performance, community, etc.). 
    2. With the help of Terraform, we have started running some infrastructures like databases, message queue, logging stack etc. (If you are a DevOps, [weâ€™re hiring](https://www.notion.so/Open-Source-Remote-RSS4-Offering-the-Dopest-Positions-Android-Developers-Front-end-Engineers-a-b6fdbffee017449797397f45340de9d4)!)
    3. We are also in the middle of a migration to another IaaS provider, so we have spent some time migrating databases.
4. We have been busy refactoring in golang.

## What is going to happen

With the release of the protocol v0.4.0, the team will be concentrating on the refactoring work for PreGod, predominantly on database logic and assets indexing.

As we expect the first MVP to be released by the end of March 2022, this will be our major focus for weeks to come (it also means the â€˜What has happenedâ€™ section will be short).

Thatâ€™s it for the week, see you all next week!
